# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Here are some things you should know.

## Getting started

To get started:

- fork this project on github
- create a new branch named after the change you want to make; i.e., `git checkout -b mynewfeature`
- make your changes and commit them
- run the tests to make sure you haven't broken anything: ```rspec```
- send a pull request to this project from your fork/branch

Once you've sent your pull request, one of the project collaborators will review it and provide feedback. Please accept this commentary as constructive! It is intended as such.

## git

We're opinionated about git. Don't be surprised if we ask you to update your pull request to meet the following standards.

- rebase+squash your branch into a single commit. For clean git history, we'd prefer we merged in just 1 commit that contains the entire set of changes.
- don't write commit messages longer than 50 characters. See [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for some examples of how to achieve this, and why.
